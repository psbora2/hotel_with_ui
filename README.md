# - Solution: 

for getting available rooms 

first find which rooms are booked in given date (15-2-2017, 20-2-2017)
  

    Booking.where("start_date < ? AND last_date > ? ", 20-2-2017 , 15-2-2017 )


then exclude these rooms from remaining rooms ("Deluxe Rooms")

    Rooms.where("room_type = ? AND id NOT IN (?)", Room.room_types["Deluxe Rooms"], Booking.where("start_date < ? AND last_date > ? ", 20-2-2017 , 15-2-2017 ).collect(&:id))
